# Methods in Java

A **method** in Java is a block of code that performs a specific task. Methods allow code to be reused, organized, and modularized for better readability and maintainability.

## Key Features of Methods

2. **Modularity**: Break complex problems into smaller, manageable parts.
3. **Parameters and Return Types**: Accept input and return output.
